# Spam_Email_Detection



ðŸ”¸ What is Natural Language Processing?

NLP is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software. Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information. Like the topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it.



ðŸ”¸ About the Project:

Today, email is mostly shared by everyone to share the information and files because of their easy way of communication and for their low cost. But the rate of spam emails is increasing everyday. This increasing amount of spam mail causes traffic congestion and waste of time for those who are receiving that spam mail. Sometimes, the spam emails also have some links which have malware. To reduce all these risks, I have made a deep learning network which will detect spam and non-spam emails.

Here I have used Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier because the data is in a discrete form.
